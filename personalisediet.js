      {text: " Whole Grain Foods to Eat for PrediabetesWhole grains are loaded with fiber – so when you eat them, digestion slows and in turn, prevents your blood sugar from rising rapidly.Whole grains can also help promote bowel regularity, regulate blood sugar levels, and achieve healthy blood pressure.Choosing whole grains over refined grains can help to maintain optimum blood sugar readings.Steel-cut oats DO:Choose old fashioned or steel cut oats (the less refined, the better!) Add flavor using cinnamon, nuts, nut butter, or fruitUse low fat milk or waterDON'TChoose pre-packaged or sweetened oatmeal.Add too much dried fruit or sweetener (even natural sweeteners such as honey)Use creamStone-Ground Whole Wheat BreadDO:Top with heart-healthy fat spreads like avocado or nut butterTop with fruits, veggies, and lean proteins like banana, tomato, or eggSpread your consumption throughout the dayDON'T:Use spreads like butter, sweetened jam and NutellaFill with highly processed foods like deli meats and cheesesEat a lot in one sitting  Non Starchy Vegetable Foods to Eat for PrediabetesNon-starchy vegetables are full of vitamins, minerals and fiber with few calories and carbohydrates. Not only do they give you a dose of much needed nutrients, but these veggies will also add a pop of color to your plate! Non-starchy vegetables can help you stay hydrated – because they are high in water content as well.CarrotsDO:Add salt-free seasonings for some flavorRoast em', steam em', or air fry em'!Eat them raw with some hummusAdd them to your favorite dish!DON'T:Deep fry themSauté them in butter or top them with cheeseLeafy GreensDO:Eat them cooked or rawBuy them fresh or frozenPack them into smoothies or make them into a pesto sauceSneak them into soups and stews or eat them as a side dishDON'TSauté them in butter or animal fatsBoil them for too long- the nutrients in leafy greens are water-soluble, so if boiled for too long all of the nutrients will end up in the water!Use canned greens- these tend to have added seasonings and preservativesStarchy Vegetable Foods to Eat for PrediabetesStarchy vegetables provide a range of beneficial nutrients and when eaten in moderation, can be a healthy addition to your diet. One big difference between starchy and non-starchy vegetables is carb content and calories. Compared to non-starchy vegetables, they are higher in carbohydrates and higher in calories. However, most starchy vegetables rank low to medium in glycemic index. Therefore, they only produce a slow, low rise in blood sugar levels despite their high carbohydrate content.SquashDO:Include winter and summer squashRoast, bake, or sauté using olive oilSeason with fresh herbs and spicesDON'TSauté in butter or animal fatsSeason with excess amounts of sweeteners or salt BeansDO:Use dried beansUse canned beans (be sure to rinse them to get the excess salt off from the canning process!)Jazz them up by throwing them in a chili, making them into burgers, or making a dipDON'T:Use baked beans or refried beansEat a large quantity at once, stick to a half cup portion at a timeDairy Foods to Eat for PrediabetesThe way dairy affects your blood sugar is a bit complicated and challenging to unpack. For instance, milk contains natural sugars, but also contains protein and fat. The protein and fat help glucose enter the bloodstream in a slow and steady fashion. The carbohydrate source in dairy is lactose, a naturally occurring sugar that doesn’t spike blood sugar levels as rapidly as refined sugars do.Greek YogurtDO:Look for an unsweetened optionAdd nuts, seeds, or nut butterUse it as a base for a smoothie or sauceTop it with fresh fruitDON'T:Buy a pre-sweetened optionTop it with sugary granola or cerealsMix in too many sweeteners, even natural sweeteners like honeyProtein Foods to Eat for PrediabetesProtein, along with fats and carbohydrates, is one of the three main energy providing macronutrients. Protein has only a small effect on blood sugar levels – although protein tends to help stabilize blood sugars by blocking absorption of carbohydrates and sugars. Because protein helps regulate blood sugar absorption, we strongly suggest eating a protein serving at every meal.SalmonDO:Season with fresh herbs and spicesUse lemon to add a citrus noteBake, grill, or pan searDON'T:Cook with butterUse sugar-filled marinades or glazesDeep fryEggsDO:Eat the whole egg- the yolk has more protein per weight than the white does, so the whole egg is a great source of lean protein!Use cooking spray to prevent the eggs from sticking to the panDON'T:Use butter or an excess of oil while cookingFats to Eat for PrediabetesFat, like protein, has little direct effect on blood glucose levels. However, consuming too much fat contributes to insulin resistance over time. Replacing saturated fats with healthy fats can lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin regulation.NutsDO:Look for a raw or roasted option with no added seasoningsEat them in the form of an all natural nut butterAdd them to yogurt, granola, salads, or eat them as a snackBe mindful of portions- although they are healthy fats, they are still calorie-dense!DON'T:Opt for a flavored option- these tend to include high amounts of sugar, salt, and extra caloriesUse a nut butter with added sugars- look for brands that just have the nut as the ingredients!Consume them in excessChoose a trail mix that is loaded with chocolate and fried fruit with sugar added  Functional Foods for PrediabetesAside from these everyday foods, there are also a handful of \"functional\" foods that can regulate blood sugar levels. Functional foods are naturally occurring foods that are shown to have additional medicinal benefits beyond basic nutrition. Try mixing these into your snacks and meals:Cinnamon:  Cinnamon has natural qualities that can be very beneficial for people with blood sugar issues (people who have prediabetes). The active compound in cinnamon can help regulate glucose levels. Large review studies show positive outcomes from using cinnamon for blood sugar control.  Results included modest reduction in blood sugar levels and improved glucose responses in people with type 2 diabetes.Chia Seeds: Chia seeds improve glucose and insulin tolerance because of its high fiber, healthy fat and protein content. They also help reduce inflammation.  Turmeric: This golden spice offers antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that play a role in lowering blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity.Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Olive oil is known for its powerful healthy benefits, including everything from reducing inflammation to supporting balanced blood sugar which makes this fat effective for prediabetes management.Flax Seeds: Flax seed contains omega-3 fatty acids, protein and soluble fiber. Their carbohydrates consist of mostly fiber - and since fiber plays a major role in regulating blood sugar levels, flaxseed is an amazing addition to the diet regarding prediabetes management.Apple Cider Vinegar: Apple cider vinegar has been shown to significantly improve insulin sensitivity and decrease fasting and post-meal blood sugar levels.Garlic: Studies show that consuming garlic could help reduce levels of blood sugar in people suffering with prediabetes."},
